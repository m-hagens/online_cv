summary: "I am an ambitious and spontaneous Project Manager at RetailDetail, ready for a new challenge in my career. At RetailDetail, a leading B2B-community in the Benelux, I've had the opportunity to develop my skills in different disciplines, all while staying at the core of what is happening in the FMCG landscape. I was able to grow professionally by being responsible for a wide range of projects, from building and inspiring setting for retailers to tackling the difficulties for the retail sector in a post-covid setting. Today, 4 years since joining RetailDetail, I am ready to push myself towards new horizons and would like to become part of one of the most inspiring and promising stories in the corporate landscape."
